Pi-calculus in SCala aka PISC ala RISC
======================================

The π-calculus maps one to one on `Scala` for-comprehensions
"inside" the Cats Effect's `IO[Unit]` monad.

[Stochastic π-calculus](https://github.com/sjbiaga/pisc/tree/stochastic) is in alpha stage.
[Polyadic π-calculus](https://github.com/sjbiaga/pisc/tree/polyadic) is also supported.
[Ambient Calculus](https://github.com/sjbiaga/pisc/tree/ambient) is nicely done, too. In a
similar way - somehow combining π-calculus with ambients - is implemented
[π-calculus with transactions](https://github.com/sjbiaga/pisc/tree/transactions).
